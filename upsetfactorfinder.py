welcome to the pty stats program
i use this program for tournaments to calculate upset factors for tournaments as they happen
it works in a few steps

THIS ONLY WORKS FOR DOUBLE ELIMINATION TOURNAMENTS!! a different version would have to be made for single elim or triple elim

it takes a seeding
and converts that to an expected placing
which it then converts to a top X finish (e.g. top 32 finish or top 8 finish)
which it then converts to the final projected loser's round you're expected to finish at
        top 1 -> 1st round
        top 2 -> 2nd round
        top 3 -> 3rd round
        top 4 -> 4th round
        top 6 -> 5th round
        top 8 -> 6th round
        top 12 -> 7th round
        top 16 -> 8th round
        top 24 -> 9th round
        top 32 -> 10th round
        top 48 -> 11th round
        so on and so forth

then you do winner's round number - loser's round number to get upset factor
e.g.    51 seed beats 11 seed
        51 -> 49th place -> top 64 -> fplr 12
        11 -> 9th place -> top 12 -> fplr 7
        12 - 7 = upset factor 5

you may wonder "why go from seeding to placing to round? why not just go seeding to round?"
        a: it's just easier that way. i've thought about ways to go from seeding to round 
        in one step but they usually involve sneakly going to the placement first because 
        it's a nice way to normalize the seeding
